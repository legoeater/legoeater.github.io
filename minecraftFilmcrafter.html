<h2>My Brief Review of Minecraft (so far)</h2>

<p>Even though I started not too long ago, Minecraft is my favorite game. I like exploring the land, and building is fun. The suspense at sundown is spine-tingling, because if I'm far away from my shelter at that time I panic a little. I was once out of my shelter during night time looking for caves to mine some iron. Not pleasant. I was almost back to the house when a creeper killed me.<br>
Despite its frustrating factors and slow gameplay, Minecraft is a game for people who are creative, adventurous, or both.</p>
